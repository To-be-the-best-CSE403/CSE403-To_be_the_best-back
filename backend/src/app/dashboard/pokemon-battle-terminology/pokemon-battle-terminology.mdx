# Pokémon Battle Terminology

**Terms listed**: Effectiveness (no effect, not very effective, super effective), generation, health points/HP, format(s), move(s), Pokemon, Pokemon battle,  power points/PP, stats, team, team building, type, weather condition

* **Effectiveness**: An attack in pokemon can be categorized based on how “effective” (a multiplier added on top of damage) it is. These are all determined by the type of the damaging move and the type(s) of the Pokemon the move is used against. There are three types of effectiveness in addition to the x1 normal damage effectiveness:
    * **No effect**: the attack gets a 0x multiplier.
    * **Not very effective**: the attack gets a 0.5x multiplier
    * **Super effective**: the attack gets a 2x or a 4x multiplier, depending on the Pokemon’s type or types that the move is targeting
* **Generation**: Also referred to as “gen”. A generation is a subset of all Pokemon that were first released in a certain group of Pokemon video games within a certain period of time. For example, gen 1 Pokemon are Pokemon that were first released in the first Pokemon games: Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow. Gen 1 spans 1996-1998 because those were the years Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow were released both internationally and in Japan.
* **Health points**: Commonly referred to as HP. A unit that represents the amount of damage a Pokemon can withstand before a Pokemon reaches 0 HP and is knocked out or has fainted. HP can be replenished through Pokemon moves and items.
    * **Knocked out/Fainted**: When a Pokemon is unable to be used in battle until it is revived by a move or an item.
* **Format(s)**: Pokemon Showdown has multiple different “formats” in which different Pokemon are allowed depending on how strong they are in addition to their characteristics. This is similar to real life competitions that are split into age groups to level the playing field. There are also formats with different rulesets such as 2v2 or 1v1.
* **Move(s)**: A move is an action that a Pokemon can take. Each Pokemon has a moveset consisting of up to 4 moves and there are various types of moves. A move may deal damage, cause a status effect, cause or change the weather condition, and/or change a Pokemon’s stats or type.
* **Pokemon**: A Pokemon is any of the monster characters that appear in the media known as Pokemon and are used in Pokemon battles.
* **Pokemon battle**: Where two players use their Pokemon in their Pokemon team against each other. A player can have their Pokemon use a move or switch their current Pokemon to another Pokemon in their team. In certain formats, each player may have one or two Pokemon out at the same time. The player that has no more Pokemon able to fight, in other words all 6 Pokemon have fainted, loses while the player that has at least one Pokemon able to fight wins.
* **Power points**: Commonly referred to as PP. A unit that represents the amount of time a Pokemon’s move can be used before the Pokemon is unable to use it. PP can be restored  through items.
* **Stats**: Values associated with a specific Pokemon that determines whether a Pokemon will act before another Pokemon, how much damage its moves will do, and how much damage it will take. Certain moves increase or decrease a Pokemon’s stats.
* **Status effects**: a category describing a variety of special conditions that moves can apply to Pokemon that are not “damage”.
* **Team**: A set of Pokemon used in Pokemon battles. Certain Pokemon battle formats limit a team to a certain generation or group of Pokemon. Other formats may limit the amount of Pokemon in a team, although the standard number of Pokemon in a team is 6.
* **Team building**: The process of creating a team of Pokemon to play with.
* **Type**: types are properties applied to Pokemon and each of their moves. There are 19 different types currently and a Pokemon can have 1-2 of them while a move gets 1. These determine certain interactions between Pokemon and their moves.
* **Weather condition**: weather can be set in a Pokemon battle that can have various effects depending on the type of weather.
