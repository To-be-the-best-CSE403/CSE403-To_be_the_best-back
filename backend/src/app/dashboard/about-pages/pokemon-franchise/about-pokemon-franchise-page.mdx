# About the Pokémon franchise

The Pokémon franchise was created in Japan in 1996 and is still developing new games and apps today. The first Pokémon games (Pokémon Red and Green) were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo in 1996 for the Game Boy. Since then, the Pokémon franchise has expanded to have comics, animation series, movies, a trading card game, merchandise, more main video games installments, and spin-off games. Given Pokémon's age, both kids and adults are fans of Pokémon, with Pokémon being a part of some of these adults' childhoods.
