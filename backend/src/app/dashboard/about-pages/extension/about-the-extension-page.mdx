# About the ToBeTheBest Extension

The ToBeTheBest extension adds a sidebar to the right of the Pokémon Showdown webpage that has a Teambuilder section which allows users to select a team archetype and import team from that archetype directly into Pokémon Showdown. The ToBeTheBest sidebar also has a resources section with links to our website, wiki, and GitHub.

With many websites about Pokémon type effectiveness, Pokémon archetypes, and the most popular Pokémon, items, and moves, the ToBeTheBest extension hopes to be a one-stop resource for any Pokémon trainer looking to battle on Pokémon Showdown.

The extension uses a webscraper on [Smogon](https://www.smogon.com/stats/) to collect data on the most popular Pokémon used as well as their most popular items, moves, and teammates. This information is stored on our backend database and certain data is queried when the user imports a team from the extension's teambuilder.

The extension adds new buttons and a sidebar directly into Pokémon Showdown, so it may be difficult to see what the extension adds. Below, is a comparison of the Pokémon Showdown before and after installing the extension.
