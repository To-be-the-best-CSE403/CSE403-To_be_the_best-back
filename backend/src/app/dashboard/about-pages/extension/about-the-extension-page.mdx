# About the ToBeTheBest Extension

The ToBeTheBest extension adds a side bar to the right of the Pokémon Showdown webpage that has a Teambuilder section that allows users to select a team and import that team directly into the user's teams. The To Be the Best side bar also has a resources section to our website, wiki, and GitHub.
