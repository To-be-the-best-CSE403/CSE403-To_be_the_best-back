Pokémon Showdown has two main features: teambuilding and battling.

For any unfamiliar terms, please refer to the [Pokémon Battle Terminology](https://tobethebest.vercel.app/dashboard/pokemon-battle-terminology) page.

## Teambuilding ##
    Pokémon Showdown allows users to build various Pokémon teams for many formats. After selecting a battle format, players will be able to select a certain amount of Pokémon for their team. Each Pokémon will have their own set of stats, moves, abilities, and items.

    One difficulty with teambuilding is that it can be difficult to know which Pokémon will work best with what other Pokémon in a team. And for a specific Pokémon in a given team, it can also be hard to know what stats, moves, abilities, and items works best.

    Still, [Pokémon Showdown offers its users a lot of control and flexibility over their Pokémon unlike the original Pokémon games](https://www.cbr.com/pokemon-showdown-battle-simulator-competitive-play/). This flexibility is one main reason why Pokémon Showdown is popular in the Pokémon community.

## Battling ##
    Pokémon Showdown offers its players lots of different battle types, each with their own set of rules and allowed Pokémon. While Pokémon Showdown may not have all the different kinds of battles the original Pokémon games have, there may be a format that works for each user.

    For instance, [Pokémon Showdown has battle formats](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/) like:
    - Random, which is a category of battles where teambuilding is not needed since each player gets a random Pokémon team for each battle
    - 1v1
    - National Dex
    - Free-For-All
    - STABmons
    - [And much more!](https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/formats/)
