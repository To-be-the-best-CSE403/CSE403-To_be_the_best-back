# About Pokémon Showdown

Pokémon Showdown is an online Pokémon battle simulator that allows players from all over the world to battle their Pokémon against each other.

According to Blake Johnson in their article "[Why Pokémon Showdown Is a Vital Tool for Competitive Play](https://www.cbr.com/pokemon-showdown-battle-simulator-competitive-play/)", at any given time, there is usually over 10,000 active players and over 2,000 battle on Pokémon Showdown. This means that there are at least 4,000 players battling against each other with teams that they've built themselves or are randomly generated.
