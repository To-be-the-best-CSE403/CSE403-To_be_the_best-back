## Overview

- Stall **stall**
- Bulky Offense **bo**
- Balance **balance**
- Weather **weather**

## Hyper Offense

Hyper Offense is a very aggressive team archetype focused on overwhelming opponents with multiple powerful setup sweepers and offensive pressure.

### Strategy

The primary strategy of Hyper Offense teams is to set up and unleash devastating attacks as quickly as possible,
aiming to break through the opponent's team before they have a chance to respond effectively.
Hyper Offense teams require aggressive play and careful prediction to succeed,
but when executed effectively, they can overwhelm opponents with sheer offensive power.

### Key Components

- **Setup Sweepers**: Pokémon like Volcarona and Hatterene serve as powerful setup sweepers capable of boosting their stats to devastating levels.
- **Hazard Support**: Pokémon providing entry hazard support with Stealth Rock or other moves, further pressuring the opponent.
- **Offensive Pressure**: Pokémon like Kingambit and Iron Boulder bring immediate offensive pressure with their powerful STAB moves.

## Stall

Stall is a team type that focuses on playing a long game, using high HP and Defense Pokémon to make it difficult for your opponent to break through your defenses while their own Pokémon are slowly defeated.

### Strategy

The primary strategy of Stall teams is to create an environment where your opponent's Pokémon cannot output enough damage on your own Pokémon, causing them to slowly whittle away at their moveset until they have no usable moves, causing them to essentially lose. These teams usually rely on several Pokémon with high HP or moves that inflict status conditions in order to slowly remove your opponent's ability to fight.

### Key Components

- **Hazard Support**: Pokémon providing entry hazard support with Stealth Rock or other moves, further pressuring the opponent.
- **Status Applier**: Pokémon that can apply a status condition, usually Poison or Badly Poison, to the opponent, limiting the longevity of their Pokémon.

## Bulky Offense

Bulky Offense is a team type that is similar to Hyper Offense, but the main offensive Pokémon is intended to also endure several hits, instead of being a glass cannon.

### Strategy

Bulky Offense relies on a similar strategy as Hyper Offense, but with a few changes. The main offensive Pokémon is no longer as fragile, so the player doesn't have to worry about executing the perfect move in each scenario in order to avoid losing the momentum that they have obtained.

### Key Components

- **Hazard Support**: Pokémon providing entry hazard support with Stealth Rock or other moves, further pressuring the opponent.
- **Offensive Pressure**: Pokémon like Kingambit and Iron Boulder bring immediate offensive pressure with their powerful STAB moves. In Bulky Offense, these Pokémon should have high HP and/or Defense stats.

## Balance

Balance is a team type that combines aspects of several teams, aiming to create a team that is equipped to handle almost any battle scenario.

### Strategy

Balance's strategy combines several team components in order to theoretically cover every possible threat. These usually include an offensive Pokémon, a defensive wall, and other roles from other team compositions. 

### Key Components

- **Hazard Support**: Pokémon providing entry hazard support with Stealth Rock or other moves, further pressuring the opponent.
- **Offensive Pressure**: Pokémon like Kingambit and Iron Boulder bring immediate offensive pressure with their powerful STAB moves.
- **Status Applier**: Pokémon that can apply a status condition, usually Poison or Badly Poison, to the opponent, limiting the longevity of their Pokémon.

## Weather

Weather is a team archetype that is designed around making use of various weather conditions, such as sun or hail.

### Strategy

The primary strategy of Weather teams is to set up a weather condition and utilize Pokémon that have abilities or moves that take advantage of this weather condition. Since these Pokémon are not always common in every team, most of the conditions will only benefit the user, giving them an advantage for the rest of the battle. Despite this, the opponent can counter with abilities that remove the weather or changing the weather to one that is optimal for themselves, so the player must be always ready to re-set their desired weather condition to achieve a win.

### Key Components

- **Weather Setter**: Pokémon with an ability that allows the user to immediately begin the battle with the desired weather condition on their field. These abilities include Snow Warning and Drought.
- **Setup Sweeper**: Pokémon like Volcarona and Hatterene serve as powerful setup sweepers capable of boosting their stats to devastating levels; in weather teams, these Pokémon usually have an ability or move that takes advantage of the weather.
