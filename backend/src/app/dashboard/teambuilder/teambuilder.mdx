# Teambuilder

The Teambuilder tool allows you to create Pokémon teams tailored to your strategy.

## Goals

- Focus on understanding team building in the current metagame by analyzing interactions and synergies between Pokémon sets.
- Emphasizes on the big picture, identifying broad [archetypes](https://tobethebest.vercel.app/dashboard/teambuilder/archetype) and providing insights on how to build good synergies.
- Bridge the gap between experienced players who have very specific teambuilding strategies and less experienced players who seek model teams to learn from.
